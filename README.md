# Apex Example Pipeline

This is a simple demo application for Apache Apex that shows how to implement a custom operator, how to wire it up to a Kafka topic, and write summary statistics to the console.

You'll need Java 8. Clone and run:

`mvn test`

This will compile the code and kick off a local cluster test run.
